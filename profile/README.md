Granite.Code is a project by Red Hat and IBM to create an open-source
AI code assistant using the [IBM Granite model family](https://www.ibm.com/granite),
running locally on your system.

Granite.Code is built on top [Continue](https://github.com/continuedev/continue),
and we will work closely with the Continue project to advance the capabilities
of open-source AI coding assistants, while focusing on creating on an easy-to-use
and robust experience for users who want to run Granite locally.
